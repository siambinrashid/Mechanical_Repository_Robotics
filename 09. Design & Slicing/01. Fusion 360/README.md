**(The strip at the highest)**

![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.013.png)

This is just your tool collection, you know? It’s got all the buttons. Drawing stuff, building stuff—it’s all there. And it's cool because it basically reads your mind; if you switch to a different task, the whole strip of tools switches automatically. Like, poof, new tools.

**(The vertical list on the left)**

Okay, so you build stuff, right? This list is your running list of literally everything you've made. Every single line, every bolt, every little block. If your design gets crazy busy, this list is how you find that one piece you need to hide or maybe rename it so you don't forget what it is. It's your project inventory.

**(The large space)**

![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.015.png)

Well, this is the main spot. Your digital desk. Everything you build—that’s where it lives. This is where all the action and the fun happen. You see your work right here.

- ## <a name="_wi3up6cvuwjd"></a>**ViewCube**


**(The small box, top right)**

I call this the camera holder. You click it to look at the top, or the front, or whatever. Or you can just grab it and spin the whole model around with your mouse, like you're holding it up in the air. Easy way to look at the back side.

**(Down below that box)**

These are just the controls for your view. They let you slide the picture around, or zoom way in on a tiny detail, or spin the model slowly. They also have buttons to change how the model looks—like shiny or clear or whatever you need.

**(The bar way down at the bottom)**
This thing is awesome. It's your undo history on steroids. Every single action is recorded here. If you did something ten steps ago and realized it was wrong, you jump back, fix only that one thing, and everything else you built snaps into place correctly. It's the master editor.

Selecting a side of any object or any axis from the **origin**.Go to the toolbar and select “Create Sketch”.

Every 3D part starts with a **2D sketch**. These tools help you draw the basic shapes on your virtual canvas.

- **Line** (L): Drawing a straight edge between two points.
- **Two Point Rectangle**: Clicking the **first corner**, then clicking the **opposite corner** to complete the box. You can also just type in the **width** and **height** you want.
- **Center Point Rectangle**: Clicking where the **center** should be, then dragging outward to define the size.
- **Center Point Circle**: Clicking the **center** spot, then pulling out to set the distance across (the **Diameter**).
- **Two Point Circle**: Clicking the two spots that define the total distance across the circle.
-----
**Controlling Dimensions & Constraints**\
You must use dimensions to make your shapes stay put and have the correct size.

- **Dimension Tool** (D): This is how you control the exact measurements.
  - Click a **line** or **circle** to check its length or diameter, and type in a new value.
  - **Spacing Lines/Angles:** Hold **Ctrl** and select **two lines**. You can then set the required space between them or the angle if they cross.
  - **Spacing Centers:** Hold **Ctrl** and click the **center of two circles** to control how far apart they are.
- **Quick Check:** If you just select an edge, the current **measurement** usually pops up in the corner, which is handy.
-----


**3D Feature Creation**\
After your sketch is done, you use these tools to give it volume and make copies.

- ![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.020.png)**Extrude:** This is how you "pull" a **2D shape** into a **3D solid**. You select the closed **sketch** and set the depth. You can **add** material (**Join**) or **remove** it (**Cut**).
- ![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.021.png)**Mirror:** Makes a perfect, identical copy flipped across a reference line or **plane**.
- **Pattern:** Instead of copying things one-by-one, you use this to make many copies (of a feature or a whole object) following a straight (**linear**) or round (**circular**) path.
-----
**3D Modification**\
These tools help you smooth out rough spots, hollow out parts, or change the overall size.

![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.022.png)

- **![fillet icon](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.023.png) Fillet:** **Rounds off** a sharp edge or corner. You select the edge and set the curve's **radius**.

- **![chamfer icon](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.024.png) Chamfer:** **Cuts a flat angle** on a sharp edge instead of rounding it. You set the **distance** and **angle** of the cut.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.025.png)** Shell: **Makes a solid part hollow**, like a plastic bottle. You pick the faces you want to remove to create the opening and set the **wall thickness**.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.026.png) Scale:** Makes the entire object bigger or smaller by multiplying its size by a **scale factor**.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.027.png) Combine:** **Merges** two or more solid parts into a single body. You choose whether to **join** (add), **cut** (subtract), or **intersect** them.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.028.png) Split:** Uses a **face or plane** like a knife to cut one solid body into two or more separate pieces.

## <a name="_rpsan4nrzevp"></a>**Moving Things**
- ![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.029.png)**Move:** Shifts or rotates an object along the **X, Y, or Z directions** by specific amounts.

![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.030.png)

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.031.png) Point-to-Point Move:** A fast way to move. You pick one **point on the object**, and then pick the exact **spot in space** where you want that point to end up.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.032.png) Pivot:** This lets you temporarily set a custom **center point** (**pivot**) for rotation, so you can spin the object around a specific spot.
-----
**Assembly & Joints**

Joints tell the software how separate components should interact and move together.

![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.033.png)

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.034.png) Joint Tool:** You pick **snap points** (like corners or center spots) on the two parts you want to connect.
- **Joint Types: Click on the Tab “Motion”**
  - **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.035.png) Rigid:** **Locks** the parts together completely—they can't move at all.
  - **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.036.png) Revolute (Spin) & Slider (Slide):** These allow movement. You need to set the **Minimum** and **Maximum** positions to limit how far the part can spin or slide.
  
  ![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.037.png)

- **Preview:** Always use the motion **preview** to watch the joint work and make sure it's doing what you expect!
-----

**Construction Tools**\
These tools create things that aren't part of the final product (like planes or lines) but help you sketch or build features on complicated parts.

![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.038.png)

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.039.png) Offset Plane:** Makes a new plane that is **parallel** to an existing surface, just moved by a certain **distance**.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.040.png) Plane on the Edge:** Selects a straight **edge** and creates a plane rotated off that edge by a specific **angle**.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.041.png) Mid Plane:** Creates a plane exactly **in the middle** of two selected faces.

- **![](../images/Aspose.Words.b9c50f4e-82b8-47a2-a7bc-6be21e76a9ea.042.png) Tangent Plane:** Creates a plane that just **touches** a curved surface (like a **cylinder**) without going inside it.
