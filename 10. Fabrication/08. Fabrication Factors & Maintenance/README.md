# **Module 8 — Fabrication Factors & Maintenance**

This module is about the things that slowly damage robots over time:

* vibration (shaking)  
* wear (parts rubbing and getting loose)  
* rust (metal getting weak)  
* wrong tolerances (too tight / too loose)  
* lack of lubrication (dry moving parts)

If you understand these, your robot will:

* last longer  
* move smoother  
* break less  
* need fewer emergency repairs

## **8.1 Vibration (shaking) — the silent problem**

Robots vibrate because of:

* motors spinning  
* wheels hitting bumps  
* gear teeth contact  
* unbalanced parts  
* loose frames

### **What vibration causes**

* bolts slowly loosen  
* wires shake and break  
* holes become bigger over time  
* parts crack (especially plastic)  
* sensors give noisy readings

### **Easy ways to reduce vibration**

* use **locknuts** (nyloc nuts)  
* use **washers** (helps with soft materials)  
* tighten bolts correctly (snug, not crazy tight)  
* add **brackets/gussets** to strengthen weak corners  
* support long shafts with bearings on both sides (if possible)

### **Simple check**

After running the robot for a while:

* touch the frame (carefully) and feel shaking  
* look for bolts that “walked out”  
* listen for new rattling sounds

## **8.2 Wear (rubbing damage)**

Wear happens when parts rub each other again and again.

Examples:

* shaft rubbing on a metal hole (bad)  
* plastic rubbing on metal  
* chain rubbing on frame  
* belt rubbing on pulley walls

### **Signs of wear**

* black dust near moving parts  
* shiny scratches on metal  
* increasing looseness over time  
* squeaking or grinding noise

### **How to reduce wear**

* use bearings instead of “shaft in plain hole”  
* use bushings if bearings are not possible  
* use spacers so parts don’t rub  
* keep shafts aligned so they don’t scrape sideways

---

## **8.3 Tolerances (fit too tight / too loose)**

Tolerance is basically: **how much space you leave so parts fit correctly**.

### **Too tight**

What happens:

* parts don’t assemble easily  
* bearings get squeezed and become stiff  
* shafts don’t rotate smoothly  
* plastic cracks when forced

### **Too loose**

What happens:

* wobble and shaking  
* gears don’t mesh well  
* backlash (free play)  
* robot becomes inaccurate

### **Easy way to handle tolerances**

* do a small test first (tiny sample part)  
* adjust slot size or hole size  
* don’t guess blindly

**Simple tip:**  
If it rotates, don’t make it tight.  
If it must be fixed, don’t make it loose.

## **8.4 Lubrication (oil/grease) — when to use it**

Lubrication reduces:

* friction  
* wear  
* heat  
* noise

### **When lubrication helps a lot**

* gears  
* chains  
* metal shafts in bushings  
* sliding parts  
* lead screws (if your robot uses them)

### **When lubrication is NOT needed (or can make it worse)**

* most sealed ball bearings (they already have grease inside)  
* places where dust will stick and become “sand paste”  
* electronics areas (oil can cause problems)

### **Common simple lubricants in robotics**

* light oil (for small moving joints)  
* grease (for gears, heavier load areas)  
* chain lubricant (for chain drives)

**Simple warning:**  
Don’t over-lubricate. Too much oil attracts dirt.

---

## **8.5 Rust prevention (keep metal parts healthy)**

Rust happens when metal touches water/humidity/air for long time.

### **Places rust starts fast**

* mild steel frames  
* bolts left outside  
* metal stored in wet areas

### **Easy rust prevention methods**

* paint steel parts  
* use oil film (light oil wipe)  
* use stainless hardware for outdoor robots  
* store parts dry  
* wipe water immediately after use

**Simple tip:**  
Rust also makes bolts impossible to remove later. Prevention saves future pain.

---

## **8.6 Heat and material damage**

Heat can:

* soften PLA  
* weaken some plastics  
* expand metal slightly (can change fit)  
* dry out grease over time

### **Easy heat tips**

* don’t mount PLA right next to hot motors  
* give ventilation for electronics boxes  
* don’t fully close the system if heat builds up

---

## **8.7 Maintenance habits (simple routine)**

You don’t need fancy maintenance. Just do small checks regularly.

### **After every run (quick check)**

* check if any bolts feel loose  
* look for cracks (plastic near holes)  
* look for scratches and rubbing signs  
* check belts/chains tension  
* spin wheels by hand (smooth or rough?)

### **Every few weeks (if used often)**

* clean dust and dirt  
* check bearings for roughness  
* re-tighten key bolts (frame, motor mounts)  
* re-lube chain/gears if needed

---

## **8.8 Common problems and quick fixes**

### **Problem: bolts keep getting loose**

Fix:

* use locknuts  
* add washers  
* use threadlocker (if allowed)  
* reduce vibration (stiffen frame)

### **Problem: shaft doesn’t spin freely**

Fix:

* check bearing alignment  
* check if bearing is squeezed too tight  
* check if shaft is bent  
* check if something is rubbing

### **Problem: plastic part cracks near bolt hole**

Fix:

* use washers  
* increase thickness around hole  
* add fillets (rounded corners)  
* avoid over-tightening

### **Problem: gear system becomes noisy**

Fix:

* check alignment  
* check loose screws  
* check wear  
* add proper lubrication

### **Problem: robot starts wobbling more over time**

Fix:

* check loosening bolts  
* check worn holes  
* check bearings  
* add spacers and alignment support
