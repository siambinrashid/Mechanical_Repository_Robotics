## 📌 Section Overview
The goal of this section is to provide students with the hands-on knowledge required to build functional, durable, and precise mechanical assemblies. We focus on:
* ✅ **Material Science**: Picking the right metal or plastic for the job.
* ✅ **Digital Fabrication**: Mastering Laser Cutting and CNC workflows.
* ✅ **Hand Tools**: Proper usage and workshop safety.
* ✅ **Modern Fabrication**: Introduction to Lathes and Welding.
* ✅ **Assembly Knowledge**: Ensuring solving troubleshooting.
